First we have action attribute with value index.html which is this file. Then we are going to type the method attribute with value post. The action attibute is the web address of a program that processes the information submitted via the form. The method attribrute is the HTTP method that the browsers uses to submit the form. Posible values are POST or GET. POST corresponds to the HTTP POST method. That means that data from the body of the form is sent, or posted, to the server. Get corresponds to the HTTP GET method. In this case, data is sent inside of the URL, and paratmeters are seperated with a question mark.-->
      
      
      
        <!--Lets make a simple text field where the user can type in their name.-->
        
        
          <h1>Sign up</h1> <!--Here first we provide a header for our form. This isn't required but its going to make our form look nicer.-->
        
        
        
        <!--In our case, we want to make two groups. One for basic information, and one for the information that will show up on a user's profile, after they've logged into our imaginary app. We can do that by wrapping our form controls in the fieldset element.-->
        
        
        <fieldset> <!--Here we want to wrap this from here-->
          
          
          <legend><span class="number">1</span> Your basic info</legend> <!--Here we are adding legend element for section 1 as of it there steps for the process. We also added a span element and give it a class just incase we use them for css design. Note: Span is like -->
        
        
        
        
          <!--We can label each one of our form controls using the label element.-->
          
          
           <label for="name">Name:</label> <!--Here we added a attribute for with value name. With this attribute will help us when we click the label name will automatically focus on this particular formed field. This attribute associates the label with a particular form element. The way it matches is by ID. If you remove this for attribute it wont give you focus. -->
          
          <!--Now the user knows what information they should put into each form field.-->
          
          <input type="text" id="name" name"user_name"> <!--type attribute and vaue text. The we give it a ID and a value name. Then we give a name attribute with a value of user_name.-->
          
          <!--When you save this out you see now that you a have a text area where you can type in your name.Please note: the input element is a self-closing tag. There's no need to type a closing tag to math the opening tag.-->
          
          
          <!--When we created the input element we addded three attributes here. The type attribute indicates what kind of input we want. There are many possible values for this particular attribute, such as email, tel, for telephone, and password. Just check the ones below. The ID attribute is not required, but it's a good idea to add one. This is helpful for targetting elements with CSS or Java Script. However, we'll need ID attributes so that we can associate labels to specific form controls. The name attribute is needed so that, when a form is submittedto server-side code, the server can understand the form data and process the values appropriately. We're going to prefix all our name values with user and an underscore so that it's easier to tell the difference between the name and the ID.-->

          <!--Select menus are great if you have lots of options, however, if you have something like 5 or less,its better to use radio buttons.These show you all of options at once but, like select menus, the user can only pick from one of them. Lets say for legal compliance reasons, we need to now if our users are under the age of 13 or if they're 13 or older. So here we are creating a radio buttons.-->
          
          <label>Age:</label> 
          <input type="radio" id="under_13" value="under_13" name="user_age"><label for="under_13" class="light">Under 13</label> <br> <!--since the two options are inline to each other we have to add a line break element or <br> between them so that one of them will go at the bottom. The type attribute here is radip instead of text for this particular input element.-->
          <input type="radio" id="over_13" value="over_13" name="user_age"><label for="over_13" class="light">13 or Older </label> <!--Summary: When you select one of these options, and then try to select another options, you'll see that it deselects the previous option, and the way that it knows to do that is because we have the name attribute exactly the same. So it knows that these two radio buttons are part of the same group. If we were to change the name attribure to something else, if you select one and the other one it will select both options because the browser thinks that these two radio buttons are aprt of different radio button groups.-->
        
          <!--Summary: You might still be wondering why we didn't add a for attribute to the age label. If you take a look at out label tag doesn't have a for attribute but we do have a for attribute for under_13 and over_13. The reason that we don't have a for attribute on the age level up there is because there's nothing to associate it with. The one in the input tag has particular labels have an associated radio button, but the label tag is just really justt to label this general area below. -->

In most browsers, a text area is resizable by the user. There are ways to prevent this if you like but I think its better to leave this default behavior unmodified.-->

Normally when you submit a form to server side code, each form element has an associated value for text inputs and text areas, that value is whatever the user types in to the field.

The only real difference here is the type attribute, and it's set to check box instead of radio. This will tell the browser to render checkboxes, and the user can select multiple checkboxes instead of just one of them like with radio buttons.-->

The reset type will automatically clear all form adata when it's clicked. The button type has no default behavior, and it's mostly intended to be used in combination with JavaScript. The type we have used here is submit. The default behavior of the submit type is to submit the form and send all the data over the server.-->
